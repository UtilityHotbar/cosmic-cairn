Cairn: Cosmic Edition is a hack of Cairn that is currently in release version IN_PROGRESS. Cairn is an [adventure game](http://questingblog.com/adventure-game-vs-osr) by [Yochai Gal](https://yochaigal.itch.io) about exploring a dark & mysterious Wood filled with strange folk, hidden treasure, and unspeakable monstrosities. Cosmic Cairn takes the base mechanics offered by Cairn and adds an archetype system similar to [Weird North](https://classless-kobolds.itch.io/weird-north), new mechanics for magic and Revelation, and a new astral realm to explore known as the Forest of the Stars. In short, Cairn: Cosmic Edition is Cairn, brought to the mythical Stars.
